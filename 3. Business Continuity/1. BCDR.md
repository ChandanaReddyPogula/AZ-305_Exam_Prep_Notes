# Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BC/DR)
## Key Concepts
| **Term**                     | **Description**                                                                 |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Recovery Point Objective (RPO) | Maximum acceptable data loss (time between last backup and failure).           |
| Recovery Time Objective (RTO) | Maximum acceptable downtime (time to recover after a failure).                 |
| Recovery Level Objective (RLO) | Granularity of data recovery (e.g., entire application stack or specific data). |

# Azure Site Recovery (ASR)
## Overview
- **Purpose:** Protects applications running on physical servers, VMware, Hyper-V, or Azure VMs.
- **Key Features:**
  - Near-real-time replication (RPO as low as 30 seconds).
  - Application-consistent snapshots for single/multi-tier apps.
  - Integration with SQL Server AlwaysOn, Active Directory, and Exchange DAGs.
  - Flexible recovery plans with external scripts and manual actions.
  - Advanced network management (IP reservation, load balancing, Traffic Manager integration).

## Use Cases
- **Application-Level Protection:** Replicate workloads to Azure or a secondary site.
- **Disaster Recovery Drills:** Test recovery plans without impacting production.
- **Failover/Failback:** Automate failover and failback processes.

# Azure Backup
## Overview
- **Purpose:** Protects files, folders, machine states, and workloads on-premises and in Azure.
- **Key Features:**
  - Supports Azure VMs, Managed Disks, File Shares, SQL Server, SAP HANA, PostgreSQL, Blobs, and on-premises machines.
  - Stores backups in Recovery Services Vault or Backup Vault.
  - Two-tier backup: Snapshot (local, 5 days) and Vault (long-term retention).

## Supported Workloads

|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Azure VMs                  | Back up Windows/Linux VMs using MARS agent.                                     |
| Azure Managed Disks        | Back up managed disks using Backup Vault.                                       |
| Azure File Shares          | Back up file shares using Recovery Services Vault.                              |
| SQL Server in Azure VMs    | Back up SQL Server databases.                                                   |
| SAP HANA in Azure VMs      | Back up SAP HANA databases.                                                     |
| Azure Blobs                | Protect blobs with enhanced data protection.                                    |
| On-Premises Machines       | Back up Windows Servers, Hyper-V, and VMware VMs using MARS, DPM, or MABS.     |

# Recovery Solutions
## Containers (Azure Kubernetes Service - AKS)
- **Best Practices:**
  - Deploy AKS clusters in multiple regions (use Azure-paired regions).
  - Use Azure Container Registry with geo-replication (Premium SKU).
  - Back up AKS clusters using Velero and Azure Blob Storage.

## Compute (Azure VMs)
- **Recommendations:**
  - Create backup schedules for critical/non-critical VMs.
  - Implement short-term (daily) and long-term (weekly) retention policies.
  - Use Cross-Region Restore (CRR) for secondary region recovery.
  - Optimize restore time using general-purpose v2 Storage accounts.
  - Monitor backups using Azure Monitor alerts.

## Databases (Azure SQL)
- **Built-In Features:**
  - Point-in-Time Restore (PITR): Retains backups for 7-35 days.
  - Long-Term Retention (LTR): Store backups in RA-GRS blobs for up to 10 years.
  - Automated Backups: Full weekly, differential every 12-24 hours, and transaction logs every 5-10 minutes.

## Unstructured Data (Azure Blob Storage)
- **Protection Features:**
  - Operational Backup: Protects block blobs from deletion (retention up to 360 days).
  - Soft Delete: Restore deleted containers/blobs.
  - Blob Versioning: Maintain previous versions of blobs.
  - Resource Locks: Prevent accidental deletion of storage accounts.

## Azure Storage

|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Soft Delete               | Retain deleted data for 1-365 days.                                             |
| Blob Versioning           | Maintain previous versions of blobs.                                             |
| Resource Locks            | Prevent accidental deletion of storage accounts.                                 |
| Immutable Storage         | Write Once, Read Many (WORM) for compliance.                                    |
| Point-in-Time Restore     | Restore block blobs to a previous state.                                        |
