# High Availability (HA) Design
## Key Concepts
| **Term**                     | **Description**                                                                 |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Redundancy                   | Additional components to take over in case of failure.                         |
| Monitoring                   | Gathers data to detect failures or unresponsive components.                    |
| Failover                     | Automatically switches to redundant components when a failure is detected.      |
| Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) | Average time to restore a component after failure.                             |
| Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) | Average time a component lasts between outages.                          |

## Design Considerations
- **Downtime Tolerance:** How much downtime is acceptable?
- **Cost of Downtime:** What is the financial impact of downtime?
- **Customer Requirements:** What are the availability expectations of your customers?
- **Investment vs. Risk:** Balance cost and complexity with risk tolerance.

# High Availability Solutions
## Compute (Azure VMs)
| **Solution**                     | **Description**                                                                 | **SLA**       |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Single VM                        | Basic SLA with premium storage (99.9%).                                         | 99.9%         |
| Availability Sets                | Protects VMs from localized hardware failures (update and fault domains).       | 99.95%        |
| Availability Zones               | Physically separate datacenters within a region for disaster recovery.          | 99.99%        |
| Proximity Placement Groups (PPGs)| Ensures low-latency placement of VMs.                                           | N/A           |
| Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)| Automatically scales VMs across availability zones for redundancy.              | 99.99% (with multiple zones) |

## Non-Relational Data Storage (Azure Storage)
### Redundancy Options
| **Option**                     | **Description**                                                                 | **Use Cases**                                   |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)| Data replicated 3 times within a single location.                               | Non-critical, cost-sensitive workloads.        |
| Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS)   | Data replicated across 3 availability zones in the primary region.              | High availability within a region.             |
| Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS)    | Data replicated 3 times in the primary region (LRS) + 3 times in a secondary region. | Disaster recovery across regions.             |
| Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage (GZRS) | Data replicated across 3 availability zones (ZRS) + 3 times in a secondary region. | High availability and disaster recovery.      |
| Read-Access GRS/GZRS (RA-GRS/RA-GZRS) | Adds read access to the secondary region.                              | Read-intensive workloads with HA.             |

## Relational Database (Azure SQL Database)

|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Temporal Tables                | Restore row versions from any point in time.                                    | Data recovery from accidental changes.         |
| Point-in-Time Restore (PITR)   | Restore a database to any point within the retention period (7-35 days).        | Recovery from data corruption or deletion.     |
| Long-Term Retention (LTR)      | Store backups for up to 10 years.                                              | Compliance and audit requirements.             |
| Active Geo-Replication         | Create readable replicas in different regions for manual failover.              | Regional disaster recovery.                    |
| Auto-Failover Groups           | Automatically fail over a group of databases to a secondary region.             | Regional disaster recovery.                    |

# High Availability Best Practices
## Compute
- Use Availability Sets for fault and update domain separation.
- Deploy across Availability Zones for regional redundancy.
- Use VMSS for automatic scaling and redundancy.
- Leverage Proximity Placement Groups for low-latency workloads.

## Non-Relational Data Storage
- Use ZRS for high availability within a region.
- Use GZRS or RA-GZRS for high availability and disaster recovery.
- Avoid LRS for mission-critical applications.

## Relational Database
- Enable Active Geo-Replication for cross-region redundancy.
- Use Auto-Failover Groups for automatic regional failover.
- Leverage Temporal Tables and PITR for point-in-time recovery.
- Use LTR for long-term backup retention.
