# Virtual Machine-Based Compute Solutions
## Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)
- **Type:** Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
- **Key Features:**
  - Full control over OS, software, and configurations.
  - Supports Windows (RDP) and Linux (SSH) VMs.
  - Ideal for lift-and-shift migrations and legacy applications.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Migrate on-premises servers to Azure (rehost).
  - Deploy legacy or COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) applications.
  - Full control over application servers.
  - Development/test environments with auto-shutdown for cost savings.

## Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)
- **Type:** IaaS with auto-scaling.
- **Key Features:**
  - Manages a group of identical, load-balanced VMs.
  - Automatically scales VMs based on demand or schedule.
  - Centralized management for updates and configurations.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Highly available applications.
  - Workloads requiring automatic scaling (e.g., web apps, batch processing).

## Azure Virtual Desktop
- **Type:** Desktop and application virtualization.
- **Key Features:**
  - Multisession Windows 11/10 deployments.
  - Optimized for Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise.
  - Supports Windows 7 with extended security updates.
  - Unified management for desktops and apps.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Virtual desktops for remote work.
  - Application virtualization for legacy or custom apps.

# Container-Based Compute Solutions
## Azure Container Apps
- **Type:** Fully managed serverless container service.
- **Key Features:**
  - Build and deploy cloud-native containerized applications.
  - Supports microservices, background tasks, and event-driven apps.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Modern, cloud-native applications.
  - Event-driven and background processing workloads.

## Azure Container Instances (ACI)
- **Type:** Serverless containers.
- **Key Features:**
  - Spin up containers on demand without managing infrastructure.
  - Pay only for running containers.
  - No orchestration required.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Small, event-driven applications.
  - Simple web apps and batch jobs.

## Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- **Type:** Fully managed Kubernetes orchestration.
- **Key Features:**
  - Automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized apps.
  - Handles monitoring, load balancing, and auto-discovery.
  - Free for control plane; pay only for agent nodes.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Large-scale containerized applications.
  - Microservices architectures.

# Serverless Compute Solutions
## Azure Functions
- **Type:** Event-driven serverless compute.
- **Key Features:**
  - Runs code on-demand without provisioning VMs.
  - Supports multiple programming languages (C#, Java, Python, etc.).
  - Stateless by default; use Durable Functions for stateful workflows.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Event-triggered tasks (e.g., HTTP requests, queue messages).
  - Scheduled jobs and background tasks.

## Azure Logic Apps
- **Type:** Low-code/no-code workflow automation.
- **Key Features:**
  - Automates business processes and integrates LOB applications.
  - Supports app, data, system, and B2B integration.
  - Pricing based on executions and connectors used.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Business process automation.
  - Enterprise application integration (EAI).
