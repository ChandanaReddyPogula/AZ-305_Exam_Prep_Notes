# Azure Governance Hierarchy
## Levels in the Hierarchy
| **Level**            | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Management Group     | Container for organizing subscriptions (e.g., by department, function, or environment). |
| Subscription         | Unit of billing, scale, and management. Resource limits are applied at this level. |
| Resource Group       | Logical container for organizing Azure resources within a subscription.         |
| Resources            | Leaf nodes in the hierarchy (e.g., VMs, App Service, Load Balancer).           |

## Management Group Rules
- **Max Management Groups:** 10,000 per AAD tenant.
- **Hierarchy Depth:** Up to 6 levels (excluding root and subscription levels).
- **Single Parent:** Each management group can have only one parent.
- **Single Root:** All management groups and subscriptions roll up to a single root management group.

# Azure Policy
## Key Concepts
| **Term**               | **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Policy Definition      | Rules for enforcing compliance (e.g., regulatory, security, cost).             |
| Initiative             | Group of policies applied together to a scope.                                 |
| Scope                  | Level at which policies are applied (e.g., management group, subscription, resource group). |
| Effect                 | Action taken when a resource is non-compliant (e.g., Deny, Audit, Append).     |
| Remediation Identity   | Managed identity used to remediate non-compliant resources.                    |

## Policy Assignment
When assigning a policy or initiative, specify:
- **Scope:** Where the policy applies.
- **Exclusions:** Resources to exclude from the policy.
- **Parameters:** Required inputs (e.g., location, Log Analytics workspace).
- **Noncompliance Message:** Message shown to users for non-compliant actions.

## Policy Effects
| **Effect**             | **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Append                 | Adds fields to a resource request. Acts as Deny if it overrides existing values. |
| Audit                  | Logs a warning in the activity log for non-compliant resources.                |
| AuditIfNotExists       | Audits related resources. Logs non-compliance if related resources are missing. |
| Deny                   | Blocks creation/update of non-compliant resources with a 403 error.            |
| DeployIfNotExists      | Deploys required resources for non-compliant resources.                        |
| Disabled               | Disables policy enforcement if selected during assignment.                     |
| Modify                 | Adds, updates, or removes properties/tags on resources.                        |

## Remediation Tasks
- **DeployIfNotExists** and **Modify** effects require a managed identity for remediation.
- Remediation tasks can fix existing non-compliant resources.
