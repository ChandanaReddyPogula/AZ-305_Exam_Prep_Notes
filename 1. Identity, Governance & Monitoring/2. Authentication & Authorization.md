# Zero Trust Principles
Three core principles for securing access:

| **Principle**               | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Verify Explicitly            | Authenticate and authorize every access request based on user identity, location, device health, resource, and data classification. |
| Least Privileged Access      | Grant just-in-time and just-enough access based on risk assessment. Secure data without affecting productivity. |
| Assume Breach                | Minimize exposure by isolating and segmenting access. Use end-to-end encryption and threat intelligence for visibility and protection. |

# Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
## Key Concepts
| **Term**               | **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Security Principal      | User, group, service principal, or managed identity.                           |
| Role Definition         | Built-in roles (e.g., Owner, Contributor) or custom roles.                     |
| Scope                   | Management group, subscription, resource group, or specific resource.          |
| Role Assignment         | Links a security principal to a role definition at a specific scope.           |
| Deny Assignments        | Overrides role assignments to explicitly deny permissions.                      |

# Azure Active Directory (AAD) Roles
| **Role**               | **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Global Administrator    | Full access to all AAD features. Can reset passwords for all users.            |
| User Administrator      | Manages users, groups, and support tickets. Can reset passwords for non-admins. |
| Billing Administrator   | Manages subscriptions, purchases, and support tickets.                         |

# Identity and Access Management (IDAM)
## Key Components
| **Component**           | **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Service Principal       | Identity for apps/services to access Azure resources.                          |
| Application Registration| Creates a globally unique identity (application object) in AAD.                |
| Managed Identities      | Automatically managed identities for Azure resources.                          |
| System-Assigned         | Tied to the lifecycle of a single Azure resource.                              |
| User-Assigned           | Can be assigned to multiple resources and managed independently.               |

# Azure External Identities
- **B2B (Business-to-Business):** External users use their organizational or social identities (e.g., Google, Facebook).
- **B2C (Business-to-Customer):** Separate directory for customer identity and access management.

# Azure AD Connect
## Authentication Methods
| **Method**              | **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Password Hash Sync (PHS)| Syncs password hashes to AAD for cloud authentication.                         |
| Pass-Through Auth (PTA) | Validates passwords against on-premises AD using a lightweight agent.           |
| Federation              | Delegates authentication to a trusted system (e.g., ADFS).                     |

# Azure AD Connect Health
- Monitors on-premises identity infrastructure.
- Requires deployment of an agent on related servers.

# Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
## Authentication Methods
- **Physical Possession:** Phone, key, access card.
- **Knowledge:** Password, PIN.
- **Biometrics:** Fingerprint, voice, iris.
- **Location:** Geographic location of the user.

## MFA Methods
| **Method**              | **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Microsoft Authenticator | App-based authentication.                                                      |
| Windows Hello           | Biometric or PIN-based authentication.                                         |

# Security Defaults
Preconfigured conditional access policies:
- Require MFA for all users and admins.
- Block legacy authentication protocols.
- Protect privileged activities (e.g., Azure Portal access).
